# COVID-19 Project

In this project, I investigated COVID-19 data over the past year. This data contains information about COVID-19 case counts, mortalities, vaccination rates, and various other metadata that can assist in modeling various aspects of COVID-19.

Throughout this project, I demonstrated my experience with:

- Data cleaning and EDA using Pandas
- Unsupervised and supervised learning techniques
- Visualization
